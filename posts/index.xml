      <description>Finite state machines Hybrid Meetup #43 took place 2024-05-28 at Gridfuse, Hauptpost Leipzig. We had a great presentation about a lightweight (~200 LOC), open source state machine library written in Go: ekstatic ‚Äî presentation slides (PDF)
The use case in the context of RAIDA is the modelling of workflows, composed of a number of steps (and the loose coupling of business logic with state transistions). The library is flexible, but the limits of the Go type system require to resort to any (which will defer some type checks to runtime).</description>

      <description>Fast Things First Hybrid Meetup #42 took place 2024-04-30 at CHECK24 Leipzig Office at Altes Landratsamt. We had two talks that revolved around Go and performance: Patrick Vahl gave a great overview about SIMD in Go and what is possible (and not possible), today. Examples from the talk can be found here: Crash129/go-simd-example. A few points from the talk:
 performance gains can be significant try to isolate SIMD as much as possible   The difficulty with a general purpose approach to SIMD [&amp;hellip;] is that the performance can be dramatically different on different processors.</description>

      <description>Prelude Go supports XML processing in the standard library package encoding/xml. The Marshal and Unmarshal function will use a Encoder and Decoder under the hood, as these are more general.
With a Decoder it is possible to iterate over a large number of XML elements and to deserialize data in a way that will limit memory consumption. Here is a playground example for using a decoder to repeatedly parse elements from a Reader: efY60PYLFm8.</description>

      <description>Domain Driven Data Oriented Design Hybrid Meetup #40 took place 2024-01-30 at Basislager Leipzig and we had a great presentation by Bill Kennedy from Ardan Labs about Domain Driven Data Oriented Design. A recording of the talk is available at our YouTube Channel.

All code shown in the talk is available at: ardanlabs/service.
Just a few notes from the talk:
 CRUD is boilerplate domain-driven design comes with a cost but can help to keep larger projects structured and maintainable one way to limit data exposure per domain is to create a relational view per domain example of an opaque type from the repo is user.</description>

      <description>In 2023 large language models and generative AI captured many minds - fewer know that the official Go repository included code to train a statistical language model (and to respond to prefixes) since Aug 17, 2011, which is based on chapter 3.1 from The Practice of Programming (1999), which in turn took inspiration from Dewdney, A. K. (1989), COMPUTER RECREATIONS. Scientific American, 260(6), 122‚Äì125 (the trace continues further to Shannon, 1951 and Markov, 1913)</description>

Cgo allows to bridge C and Go. From C, we can connect to other languages, like C++, too. Use cases are legacy code or performance. Implementing a pseudo-random walk (using an LCG) in both Go and C shows that C can be up to 4x faster for this particular task.

 It seems to me that these functions [append, copy] are not useful if we figure out a way to implement generics. Not necessarily a strong argument against them, I suppose, but do we want to introduce new builtin functions if we may not need them?
 About 4500 days and many proposals later, Go 1.</description>

      <description>Drinkup Notes We met 2022-12-20 19:00 at Caf√© Cantona, with no specific Go agenda, for a great exchange of ideas and experiences - too many to capture them in a blog post, so here&amp;rsquo;s just a fraction of the topics we passed (slightly categorized):
Reading list  Grokking Functional Programming - a very readable introduction to the topic; more academic angles include the classic Out of the tar pit or Purely Functional Data Structures (always nice to find references to this book in code) in 04/2022, a JS version of SICP (1984) came out: SICP JS edition, there&amp;rsquo;s an open access version, too Podman in Action, container tools with a nice Unix backdrop the classic, albeit just five year old DDIA 100 mistakes in Go and how to avoid them - actionable advice for Go code improvements  Software General  ISO 28500:2017, aka WARC is how you can capture the web - and there are many libraries and tools around this format, just to name a few: Heritrix, brozzler, webrecorder, warcprox, replayweb.</description>

      <description>Gridfuse x Leipzig Gophers Leipzig Gophers #32 took place on 2022-11-29 19:00 CET and we had a great meetup at Gridfuse&#39; new office in the heart of Leipzig. Gridfuse was founded in 2022 and builds software to bundle renewable energy sources (wind, solar, &amp;hellip;) to react to market prices - in Germany and Europe.
Predicting future energy prices is one key component, and renewables pose their own set of challenges since they depend more on external factors (like the weather, and more&amp;hellip;).</description>

Slides and code: gitlab.com/telo_tade/prefix_suffix_arrays
Problem  You are given a list of numbers. Find its longest slice that sums to zero.
 First, clarify:
 Is it a consecutive list of numbers? What kind of numbers, and how many?  We collaboratively went from a naive O(n^3) solution to a slightly improved O(n^2) one using an auxiliary data structure: a prefix sum array.</description>

For virtual meetup #22 - scheduled 2021-10-26, 19:00 CEST - we&amp;rsquo;ll have an interesting presentation on a security related topic: Confidential Computing with Go.
Join us via Zoom.
 Confidential Computing with Go Confidential computing is a new security paradigm that protects data not only at rest or in transit but also in use. A hardware-based trusted execution environment provides an isolated area, a secure enclave within a CPU, that protects sensitive data while being processed.</description>

      <description>Concise Encoding We had a great presentation about Concise Encoding, a proposed encoding standard that aims to be human and machine friendly.
 Presentation: go-concise-encoding  Here&amp;rsquo;s a recording:

Concise encoding is element-oriented (similar to e.g. JSON) and tries to solve some issues in existing standards, such as lack of types, performance and security (one similar format is Amazon Ion).
In prerelease stage, feedback is highly appreciated, a reference implementation written in Go exists at:</description>

      <description>Concurrent woes We had two input presentations, both involving concurrent constructs.
First, we heard from the author of package waitgroup about problems with concurrent code, waitgroups and shutdowns (especially in cloud native and serverless scenarios). The basic problem: At shutdown time, you want to be graceful, but at the same time enforce a hard timeout on a number of processes running (and potentially joining in a wg.Wait).
Enter package waitgroup which allows to preempt running goroutines.</description>

The x/net package contains support in x/net/http/httpproxy.
A couple of fun facts from the talk:
 The first book on HTTP proxies was published in 1998: &amp;ldquo;Web Proxy Servers&amp;rdquo; by Ari Luotonen (CERN), who also wrote a web proxy tunneling draft.</description>

      <description>üîó Anatomy of a Go module proxy  The Go packaging story started many years ago with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT and a myriad of tools for managing dependencies. And, annoyingly GOPATH was one of the main obstactles for people getting started with Go. Since Go 1.11, we have experimental support for Go modules.
A new component related to modules is the module proxy. A bit of history, internals and pitfalls has been compiled by klingtnet into a great talk.</description>

      <description>üîó Concurrency in Go  Concurrency is hard, but the primitive building blocks of CSP in Go - goroutines and channels - can make things simpler.
We glanced at the six chapters of Concurrency in Go, and learned a bit about the problem setting, goroutine sizes, context switch times and patterns.
The notes can be found here:
 Notes on Concurrency in Go  In the book, the perf tool is used to benchmark context switch times of the kernel - and to compare it with context switch times in the Go scheduler.</description>

      <description>üîó TL;DR  We will reshuffle meetups a bit: The current Go and Cloud Native meetup will be split up, into a Go focussed meetup (we will keep the Meetup group, just rename it) and a dedicated Cloud Native Meetup - which might be merged with the growing Linux Meetup Leipzig.
If you have not attended Linux Meetup Leipzig yet and you are interested in Enterprise Linux and Cloud Native topics, please join.</description>

      <description>üîó Bits from the IO package  The IO package is a central package in the standard library, as it provides (among other things) two main interfaces:
 io.Reader io.Writer  In a lightning talk we dug a bit into the package:
 Slides (PDF) Repo  The IO model is simple and powerful (and reminds one of UNIX pipes).
üîó Automate the Web with chromedp  In a code walkthrough we explored chromedp, a pure Go library talking the Chrome devtools protocol.</description>

      <description>üîó Lightning Network Micropayments  Go is popular in the crypocurrency space. The well-rounded standard library and great support for networking applications might be one reason. In Meetup #4 Philipp presented an introduction to Bitcoin, Lighting Network and a Go project, that makes micropayments for API usage really simple: ln-paywall.
The presentation is available as PDF.
An http middleware takes care of creating invoices per request, a complete example can be implemented in a few lines.</description>
