      <description>Domain Driven Data Oriented Design Hybrid Meetup #40 took place 2024-01-30 at Basislager Leipzig and we had a great presentation by Bill Kennedy from Ardan Labs about Domain Driven Data Oriented Design. A recording of the talk is available at our YouTube Channel.

All code shown in the talk is available at: ardanlabs/service.
Just a few notes from the talk:
 CRUD is boilerplate domain-driven design comes with a cost but can help to keep larger projects structured and maintainable one way to limit data exposure per domain is to create a relational view per domain example of an opaque type from the repo is user.</description>

      <description>Free Form Meetup #37 Since starting Leipzig Gophers almost four years ago we always aimed at connecting people and to learn about interesting Go projects and we had a lot of fun organizing that. Meetup #37 on 2023-09-26 aimed to be a free-form event, that is an event without a defined agenda with an opportunity to meet and discuss.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try to sharpen the free-form event format in the future.</description>

      <description>Cgo experiments Hybrid meetup #35 took place 2023-04-18 19:00 at Basislager Leipzig and was all about Cgo.
Cgo allows to bridge C and Go. From C, we can connect to other languages, like C++, too. Use cases are legacy code or performance. Implementing a pseudo-random walk (using an LCG) in both Go and C shows that C can be up to 4x faster for this particular task.

      <description>Drinkup Notes We met 2022-12-20 19:00 at CafÃ© Cantona, with no specific Go agenda, for a great exchange of ideas and experiences - too many to capture them in a blog post, so here&amp;rsquo;s just a fraction of the topics we passed (slightly categorized):
Reading list  Grokking Functional Programming - a very readable introduction to the topic; more academic angles include the classic Out of the tar pit or Purely Functional Data Structures (always nice to find references to this book in code) in 04/2022, a JS version of SICP (1984) came out: SICP JS edition, there&amp;rsquo;s an open access version, too Podman in Action, container tools with a nice Unix backdrop the classic, albeit just five year old DDIA 100 mistakes in Go and how to avoid them - actionable advice for Go code improvements  Software General  ISO 28500:2017, aka WARC is how you can capture the web - and there are many libraries and tools around this format, just to name a few: Heritrix, brozzler, webrecorder, warcprox, replayweb.</description>

Slides and code: gitlab.com/telo_tade/prefix_suffix_arrays
Problem  You are given a list of numbers. Find its longest slice that sums to zero.
 First, clarify:
 Is it a consecutive list of numbers? What kind of numbers, and how many?  We collaboratively went from a naive O(n^3) solution to a slightly improved O(n^2) one using an auxiliary data structure: a prefix sum array.</description>

First, we heard from the author of package waitgroup about problems with concurrent code, waitgroups and shutdowns (especially in cloud native and serverless scenarios). The basic problem: At shutdown time, you want to be graceful, but at the same time enforce a hard timeout on a number of processes running (and potentially joining in a wg.Wait).
Enter package waitgroup which allows to preempt running goroutines.</description>

      <description>File Embedding We had a great input presentation on file embedding, which allows to ship additional files within a binary.
How do you put files into a binary? There a numerous tools, some of them limited, some of them with large feature sets.
Is it time for Yet Another File Embedding Tool? Yes!
That such a tool can be simple and easy to use is shown by klingtnet/embed.
Misc  awsls is a tool that uses code generation to simplify AWS command line interactions we side-tracked into note-taking, and found out that people use all kinds of journal software, from OneNote, plain text files, custom software and plain paper notebooks   Join us next time!</description>

      <description>Today we had two input presentations:
 Haystack and seaweedfs: https://github.com/miku/haystack Functional Options Pattern: https://github.com/embano1/funcy-ops  Haystack The haystack talk gave an overview about an early Facebook photo storage system and a Go project inspired by it, called seaweedfs. The seaweedfs project is great, as it is developer friendly, scales up and down and is easy to use out of the box. It offers an S3 compatible API and a FUSE filesystem option.</description>

      <description>We had a short talk about HTTP proxies in Go. As expected, Go supports the usual environment variables, like HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY - and you can easily customize the proxy selection, as we saw in an example code walkthrough of an ip rotation proxy.
The x/net package contains support in x/net/http/httpproxy.
A couple of fun facts from the talk:
 The first book on HTTP proxies was published in 1998: &amp;ldquo;Web Proxy Servers&amp;rdquo; by Ari Luotonen (CERN), who also wrote a web proxy tunneling draft.</description>

      <description>ðŸ”— Kubeflow  The data science process is not free of friction, especially when acquiring, preparing and cleaning data. But even when data is readily available, one might want to use it to train a number of ML models to perform model selection.
And what happens, if an update is available and the whole process needs to be run again? Optimally with a tested model that is put into production in a canary deployment workflow?</description>

      <description>ðŸ”— The sync package  Virtual Meetup #10 took place on Friday, April 17, 2020, 19:00 CEST via Zoom (thanks to saschagrunert and CNCF).
Michael prepared a great overview of the sync and x/sync packages, which implement concurrency related facilities (concurrency is hard with either classical approaches or CSP, as we learned from a presentation last year at meetup #2).
The overview included among other things a bug hunt in a counter example and a benchmark of the builtin map and sync.</description>

      <description>ðŸ”— Anatomy of a Go module proxy  The Go packaging story started many years ago with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT and a myriad of tools for managing dependencies. And, annoyingly GOPATH was one of the main obstactles for people getting started with Go. Since Go 1.11, we have experimental support for Go modules.
A new component related to modules is the module proxy. A bit of history, internals and pitfalls has been compiled by klingtnet into a great talk.</description>

      <description>ðŸ”— Concurrency in Go  Concurrency is hard, but the primitive building blocks of CSP in Go - goroutines and channels - can make things simpler.
We glanced at the six chapters of Concurrency in Go, and learned a bit about the problem setting, goroutine sizes, context switch times and patterns.
The notes can be found here:
 Notes on Concurrency in Go  In the book, the perf tool is used to benchmark context switch times of the kernel - and to compare it with context switch times in the Go scheduler.</description>

 io.Reader io.Writer  In a lightning talk we dug a bit into the package:
 Slides (PDF) Repo  The IO model is simple and powerful (and reminds one of UNIX pipes).

      <description>ðŸ”— Lightning Network Micropayments  Go is popular in the crypocurrency space. The well-rounded standard library and great support for networking applications might be one reason. In Meetup #4 Philipp presented an introduction to Bitcoin, Lighting Network and a Go project, that makes micropayments for API usage really simple: ln-paywall.
The presentation is available as PDF.
An http middleware takes care of creating invoices per request, a complete example can be implemented in a few lines.</description>

      <description>Our second meetup took place yesterday (2019-03-15) at Basislager Leipzig, here&amp;rsquo;s a short wrap-up:
  miku gave a lightning talk about generating Go structs from JSON and XML documents, e.g. via JSONGen or zek. Code generation is not perfect, but can save you time.
  Michael presented the paper Understanding Real-World Concurrency Bugs in Go, which compares bug classes by analyzing popular open source projects like BoltDB, etcd, Docker and Kubernetes.</description>
