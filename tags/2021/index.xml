      <description>Thanks everyone for joining our meetup (we currently have 194 members), connecting, sharing experiences and projects in 2020. A positive side-effect of remote meetups is that people join from all over the world - we were happy to have people tuning in from South America and Asia this year.
We expect a remote only meetup for the foreseeable future. So far we fixed six dates for 2021, and they will all be on Tuesdays this year.</description>
