      <description>Unfortunately, most of the meetups were remote-only again in 2021 - however, on the plus side:
we started the year with a new Leipzig Gopher mascot - thanks @klingtnet we grew from 194 to 324 members in just eleven months 📈 we had nine events, eight online, one offline (#20) we had presentations from two German startup companies (#22, #23) we started a YouTube channel (thanks @embano1), recorded three great talks (18 subscribers, 330+ views) 📹 we had a first (X-mas 🎄) quiz night (#24) on Go and some Go gotchas and found great sponsors like Jetbrains, O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Media, Manning Publications and About You (jobs) 🎁 we continued to have people joining from around the world, which is incredible 🌐 we had a lovely time hosting the meetup and hope you had that too Thanks everyone for participating, we hope to see you again in 2022!</description>

      <description>Thanks everyone for joining our meetup (we currently have 194 members), connecting, sharing experiences and projects in 2020. A positive side-effect of remote meetups during a pandemic is that people join from all over the world - we were happy to have people tuning in from South America and Asia this year.
We expect a remote only meetup for the foreseeable future. So far we fixed six dates for 2021, and they will all be on Tuesdays this year.</description>
