      <description>Errors and Glamour Meetup #28 took place on 2022-06-21 19:00 CEST virtually and was one of our most visited meetup to date - thank you all for dropping by.
We had a short presentation Never forget to handle errors, rediscovered the 1000th time by Leandro from Lightmeter (gitlab, job) about a few ways to handle errors in Go. The compiler does not complain about unchecked errors, but some linters do.</description>

      <description>We will be talking about the State of Go in 2022 at the classic and incredible Leipzig Software Craft Meetup (née Softwerkskammer) in June 2022.
Go is 12 years old at this point in time. The last years brought quite a few changes into the Go ecosystem and language and we want to highlight some of those, specifically:
 Generics Go Modules and dependency management Ecosystem developments and more …  Who, when and where?</description>

      <description>Algorithm Challenge Meetup #27 took place on 2022-05-10 19:00 CEST and was virtual again and we had an interesting problem-solving live-coding challenge.
Slides and code: gitlab.com/telo_tade/prefix_suffix_arrays
Problem  You are given a list of numbers. Find its longest slice that sums to zero.
 First, clarify:
 Is it a consecutive list of numbers? What kind of numbers, and how many?  We collaboratively went from a naive O(n^3) solution to a slightly improved O(n^2) one using an auxiliary data structure: a prefix sum array.</description>

Type Signatures How would you generate a unique fingerprint for a type? A fingerprint that would change, even if the name of the type stays the same, but e.g. fields in a struct are renamed, added or removed?</description>

      <description>Summary Meetup #23, Nov 23, 2021, originally planned on-site at Sciendis, moved online again, due to the pandemic regulations.
We had two input presentations, one about Go in a startup environment at Sciendis and reasons why Go may be a good choice. And one lightning talk about a data web service.
Go in a startup environment Sciendis develops a React Native application called Wundera with the backend service being written in Go, in a classic cloud setup.</description>

      <description>Hello, 世界!
For virtual meetup #22 - scheduled 2021-10-26, 19:00 CEST - we&amp;rsquo;ll have an interesting presentation on a security related topic: Confidential Computing with Go.
Join us via Zoom.
 Confidential Computing with Go Confidential computing is a new security paradigm that protects data not only at rest or in transit but also in use. A hardware-based trusted execution environment provides an isolated area, a secure enclave within a CPU, that protects sensitive data while being processed.</description>

      <description>Concise Encoding We had a great presentation about Concise Encoding, a proposed encoding standard that aims to be human and machine friendly.
 Presentation: go-concise-encoding  Here&amp;rsquo;s a recording:

Concise encoding is element-oriented (similar to e.g. JSON) and tries to solve some issues in existing standards, such as lack of types, performance and security (one similar format is Amazon Ion).
In prerelease stage, feedback is highly appreciated, a reference implementation written in Go exists at:</description>

A couple of people had distant memories of Pascal, which also influenced Go e.g. in declarations or conditions without parentheses.
Many people use vscode or vim, but there are also some dedicated Go IDEs, e.g. GoLand or liteide:</description>

      <description>Concurrent woes We had two input presentations, both involving concurrent constructs.
First, we heard from the author of package waitgroup about problems with concurrent code, waitgroups and shutdowns (especially in cloud native and serverless scenarios). The basic problem: At shutdown time, you want to be graceful, but at the same time enforce a hard timeout on a number of processes running (and potentially joining in a wg.Wait).
Enter package waitgroup which allows to preempt running goroutines.</description>

      <description>File Embedding We had a great input presentation on file embedding, which allows to ship additional files within a binary.
How do you put files into a binary? There a numerous tools, some of them limited, some of them with large feature sets.
Is it time for Yet Another File Embedding Tool? Yes!
That such a tool can be simple and easy to use is shown by klingtnet/embed.

      <description>We had a short talk about HTTP proxies in Go. As expected, Go supports the usual environment variables, like HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY - and you can easily customize the proxy selection, as we saw in an example code walkthrough of an ip rotation proxy.
The x/net package contains support in x/net/http/httpproxy.
A couple of fun facts from the talk:
 The first book on HTTP proxies was published in 1998: &amp;ldquo;Web Proxy Servers&amp;rdquo; by Ari Luotonen (CERN), who also wrote a web proxy tunneling draft.</description>

And what happens, if an update is available and the whole process needs to be run again? Optimally with a tested model that is put into production in a canary deployment workflow?</description>

Michael prepared a great overview of the sync and x/sync packages, which implement concurrency related facilities (concurrency is hard with either classical approaches or CSP, as we learned from a presentation last year at meetup #2).
The overview included among other things a bug hunt in a counter example and a benchmark of the builtin map and sync.</description>

      <description>🔗 Anatomy of a Go module proxy  The Go packaging story started many years ago with GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT and a myriad of tools for managing dependencies. And, annoyingly GOPATH was one of the main obstactles for people getting started with Go. Since Go 1.11, we have experimental support for Go modules.
A new component related to modules is the module proxy. A bit of history, internals and pitfalls has been compiled by klingtnet into a great talk.</description>

      <description>🔗 Concurrency in Go  Concurrency is hard, but the primitive building blocks of CSP in Go - goroutines and channels - can make things simpler.
We glanced at the six chapters of Concurrency in Go, and learned a bit about the problem setting, goroutine sizes, context switch times and patterns.
The notes can be found here:
 Notes on Concurrency in Go  In the book, the perf tool is used to benchmark context switch times of the kernel - and to compare it with context switch times in the Go scheduler.</description>

      <description>We launched! The first meetup took place yesterday (2019-02-08) at Basislager. A dozen gophers, programmers, devops developers, cluster admins and curious individuals followed our invitation.
A good mix of backgrounds, experience levels and professional contexts lead to lively discussions around Go, the language, microservices, company cultures, adoption, streaming, cruise ships, conference impressions, book tips, distributed denial-of-service attacks, kubernetes operators and much more. Thanks for joining us, we think we&amp;rsquo;re off to a good start!</description>
