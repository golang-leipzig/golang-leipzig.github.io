      <description>Prelude Go supports XML processing in the standard library package xml. The Marshal and Unmarshal function will use a Encoder and Decoder under the hood, as these are more general.
With a Decoder it is possible to iterate over a large number of XML elements and to deserialize data in a way that will limit memory consumption. Here is a playground example for using a decoder to repeatedly parse elements from a Reader: efY60PYLFm8.</description>

      <description>We launched! The first meetup took place yesterday (2019-02-08) at Basislager. A dozen gophers, programmers, devops developers, cluster admins and curious individuals followed our invitation.
A good mix of backgrounds, experience levels and professional contexts lead to lively discussions around Go, the language, microservices, company cultures, adoption, streaming, cruise ships, conference impressions, book tips, distributed denial-of-service attacks, kubernetes operators and much more. Thanks for joining us, we think we&amp;rsquo;re off to a good start!</description>
