We will be talking about the [State of Go in
2022](https://www.meetup.com/le-software-craft-community/events/286403431/) at
the classic and incredible [Leipzig Software Craft
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/LE-software-craft-community/) (née
Softwerkskammer) in June 2022.

Go is [12 years](https://go.dev/blog/12years) old at this point in time. The
last years brought quite a few changes into the Go ecosystem and language and
we want to highlight some of those, specifically:

* Generics
* Go Modules and dependency management
* Ecosystem developments and more …

Who, when and where?

* Speakers: [Andreas Linz](https://www.klingt.net/), [Martin Czygan](https://github.com/miku/)
* Date: Thu, Jun 30, 2022, 19:00 CEST
* Location: [codecentric AG](https://www.codecentric.de/), [August-Bebel-Straße 41](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/40330854) · Leipzig
