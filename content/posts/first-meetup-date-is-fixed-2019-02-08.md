The first Golang and Cloud Native Meetup will take place on Friday, 8th of
February 2019 starting 19:00 at [Basislager
Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/), ground floor.

Are you using Go? Are you curious about Go? Are you a cloud architect? You are
working on an interesting project that you would like to share? Or maybe you
just want to meet some fellow Gophers in your city? Then, by all means,
consider dropping by.

This will be our first meeting and there will be plenty of room to participate
and shape this meetup going forward.

We already have a GitHub account at
[https://github.com/golang-leipzig](https://github.com/golang-leipzig). Further
sites will be set up shortly.
