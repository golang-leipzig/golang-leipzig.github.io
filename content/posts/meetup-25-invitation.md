Hello, 世界!

Join us for [meetup #25](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/282941887/) Feb 22, 2022
19:00 CET via Google Meet:
[https://meet.google.com/fqi-juff-zwy](https://meet.google.com/fqi-juff-zwy).

We'll take a closer look at the [upcoming 1.18](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18), especially [generics](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#generics).

Thanks to the generous support by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and
[Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/), we can share a JetBrains
personal subscription and an ebook - [100 Go Mistakes and How to
Avoid Them](https://www.manning.com/books/100-go-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them) - with our participants.

Join us to discuss all things Go.
