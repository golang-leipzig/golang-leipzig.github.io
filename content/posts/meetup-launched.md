We launched! The first meetup took place
[yesterday](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/258372375/)
(2019-02-08) at [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/). A dozen gophers,
programmers, devops developers, cluster admins and curious individuals
followed our invitation.

A good mix of backgrounds, experience levels and professional contexts lead to
lively discussions around Go, the language, microservices, company cultures,
adoption, streaming, cruise ships, conference impressions, book tips, distributed
denial-of-service attacks, kubernetes operators and much more. Thanks for
joining us, we think we're off to a good start!

We discussed and collected some topics for the coming months. As people are
experimenting with or adopting Go, there seems to be an interest in the
language, its idioms and pitfalls, real-world use cases and more. We also want
to encourage people to bring their own Go projects for a friendly review, if
they like.

Here are some topics that we gathered for talks in future meetups:

* Go modules (coming in [1.12](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.12))
* The Go2 proposals
* How to structure your Go projects?
* gRPC, protobuf, usage scenarios, error handling
* kubernetes in production, real-world insights
* Go gotchas and pitfalls
* net and net/http deep dive
* Using Go in the browser with WASM
* The io package and its interfaces
* Testing in Go (httptest, coverage, race conditions)
* Favorite Go tools and projects (maybe in a lightning talk format)
* GraphQL use cases
* Proxy landscape, traefik, envoy, diy-solutions
* Profiling with Go
* Containers without docker with podman
* gVisor, Kata Containers, Firecracker: Container sandboxing

We plan a next meeting for March 2019, feel free to join our [meetup
group](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) for updates.
