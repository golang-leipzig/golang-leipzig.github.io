## KI-Tage Halle 2025

[KI-Tage Halle](https://ki-tage.webwirtschaft.net/) is a two-day event with a
broad program around AI in beautiful Halle (Saale).

We wrote a small radio stream capturing
[script](https://gist.github.com/miku/55c0c8272a9f847feb9ae845e0e6e47e) that
recorded about 2000 hours of radio in 11/2025 from four different broadcasting
stations: MDR Aktuell, DLF, DLF Kultur, DLF Nova.

We then used [canary-v2-1b](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-1b-v2) to
transscribe the mostly german audio, grepped the term "KI" and stichted
together a mostly static website, where you can glance into radio voices talking about AI:
