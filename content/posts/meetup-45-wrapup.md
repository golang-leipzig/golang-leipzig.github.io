## Testing in Go

Hybrid Meetup #45 took place
[2024-10-29](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298481354/) 19:00 at
[CHECK24](https://check24.de) Leipzig Office at Altes Landratsamt. We had two
great input presentations about open source projects in the testing domain.

### Coverage metrics

[Fabian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-g%C3%A4rtner-913584141/) analyzed
the Go coverage tool [cmd/cover](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cover) and listed some
its shortcomings and presented a tool for getting a more accurate coverage
metric: [gocoverplus](https://github.com/Fabianexe/gocoverageplus).

XXX: example of three OSS projects and the coverage difference
