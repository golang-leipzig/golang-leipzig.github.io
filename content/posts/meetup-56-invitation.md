## Quick Look at the new Go ADK

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #56 on Tuesday [Nov 25, 2025 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/de-de/leipzig-golang/events/305626275/) at
[Basislager Leipzig](https://basislager.co) we'll have a short presentation on
the newly released [Agent Development Kit (ADK) for
Go](https://github.com/google/adk-go). [They
say](https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/), you should write an agent
yourself - so we will explore what an library like Go ADK can help us with.

For LLM support, we will see how far open (weights) models can take us on nice
hardware (such as the AMD [Strix Halo
APU](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html),
as found in e.g. the [Framework Desktop](https://frame.work/de/en/desktop)).

We will have enough time for lightning talks, and also please don't hesitate to
bring your own project or any interesting find from the vast [Go
ecosystem](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2025/11/10/go-language-trends-ecosystem-2025/)!
