Hello, 世界!

Our first 2020 meetup is scheduled for Friday Feb, 21 2020, 19:00 at Basislager
Leipzig (https://www.basislager.co/).

We'll have a 30 min input presentation about Golang's standard library package
[net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/), especially extension points and
customization options for clients and alternative implementations.

As always, please bring your projects, questions, findings. Spontaneous
lightning talks and other inputs are welcome, too.

Meetup #9 special: Get a unique [10th anniversary](https://blog.golang.org/10years) Gopher pin!
