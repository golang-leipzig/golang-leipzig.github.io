Hello, 世界!

Our first 2020 meetup is scheduled for [Friday, Feb 21, 2020 19:00](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785494/) at
[Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/).

We'll have a 30 min input presentation about Golang's standard library package
[net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/), especially extension points and
customization options for clients and alternative implementations.

UPDATE: There will also be a presentation about Go 1.14 (which will be released next week) and what we already know about Go 1.15 and beyond. Slides and sources can be found [here](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/go-1.14-and-beyond/).

As always, please bring your projects, questions, findings. Spontaneous
lightning talks and other inputs are welcome, too.
