## Better software insights

> Metrics with Go and systemd + improved continuous integration

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #46 on Tuesday [Nov 26, 2024 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298066372/) at
[Basislager](https://www.basislager.co) Leipzig we will have two great
input presentations related to metrics and continuous integration:

[Leandro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrosansilva/) will tell us how he is
**Getting metrics out of systemd journal with Go** from a current C++ project,
he is working on. Arch wiki has a nice page on [systemd/Journal](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/Journal).

[Fedor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedor-dikarev/) will take us on a tour on
how to **Getting more out of your Continuous Integration (CI)**, especially:

* find flaky tests before developers will complain about them,
* find out if your migration will corrupt user data or not before clients will complain about it.

Demos will include code from
[neondatabase/gh-workflow-stats-action](https://github.com/neondatabase/gh-workflow-stats-action/)
and
[neondatabase/create-branch-action](https://github.com/neondatabase/create-branch-action),
which come from the [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) project, a serverless
postgres database.

Join us for discussions and insights on how to better understand your software
and systems!
