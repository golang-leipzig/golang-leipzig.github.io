Hello, 世界!

In 2023, we want to try out a new format in this blog, which we call *Beach Reads*: short reviews of publications concerning Go and Cloud related
topics.

We start with a few reviews and encourage you to participate by sending us a
snippet or draft (e.g. in [Docs](https://docs.google.com/). Key facts:

* Review item: a technical book or [paper](https://scholar.archive.org/search?q=%22go+programming+language%22+OR+%22golang%22&sort_order=time_desc)
* Length: between ~250 and ~1500 words
* Language: english
