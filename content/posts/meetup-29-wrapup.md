## All things Go and beyond

We met on 2022-07-14 at [Soltmann Bar](https://www.soltmann-bar.de/) and it was great to see
everyone in person and also to welcome new Gophers.

In September, we hope to follow up with an [in-person meetup](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/286871365/) featuring a
presentation from [immudb](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb):

> immudb is database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. It can
> track changes in sensitive data and the integrity of the history will be
> protected by the clients, without the need to trust the server.

In case you did not know: [Immutability changes
everything](https://fatcat.wiki/release/7t5f6gtalvfcxecl7q6zw2mrzi) ☯️

Have a pleasant summer and see you in fall!
