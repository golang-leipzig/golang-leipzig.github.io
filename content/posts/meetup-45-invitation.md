## Testing in Go

Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå!

For meetup #45 on Tuesday [Oct 29, 2024 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298481354) at
[CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/) Leipzig Office we are lucky to have two great input
presentations and the overarching topic will be **Testing in Go**.

* [Fabian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-g%C3%A4rtner-913584141/) will take a closer look at **Test Coverage in Go**
* [Jan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-z-255b28225/) will present an open source project **[Timestone](https://github.com/Metamogul/timestone) ‚Äì deterministic concurrency in go tests**

> The missing ability in Go's standard lib to mock time and concurrency poses a
> significant problem when testing concurrent code. Timestone presents a
> simple, yet versatile solution.

and learn about how you can improve your Go projects.
