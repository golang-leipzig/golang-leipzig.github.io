### Downhill from here

Hybrid Meetup #57 took place
[2026-01-27](https://www.meetup.com/de-de/leipzig-golang/events/312537678)
19:00 at [Basislager Leipzig](https://basislager.co) and we had a great
presentation by [Karl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karl-breuer-4b71a8177/),
mixing math and code in his open source [OnlyOffice NLP
Solver](https://github.com/Karl1b/only-office-nlp-solver) plugin.


## Misc

* Will open source survive AI? When it becomes cheaper to generate code than to
  search for an open source solution, that may or may not cover all the
  requirements?
* Go has [Web Assembly](https://go.dev/wiki/WebAssembly) support since [1.11](https://go.dev/doc/go1.11#wasm), released 2018-08-24
