## Go 1.18 and generics

[Meetup #25](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/282941887/) was
virtual again and we were glad to have an international audience again.

We had a great presentation about the upcoming [Go 1.18](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18) release, including generics and fuzzing:

* [Go 1.18 with some fuzzing and a focus on generics](https://www.klingt.net/articles/go-1-18-with-some-fuzzing-and-a-focus-on-generics.html)

As always, Go 1.18 will include lots of smaller tweaks and improvements, like a
new [debug/buildinfo](https://pkg.go.dev/debug/buildinfo) package, which

> provides access to information embedded in a Go binary about how it was built,

or [MaxBytesHandler](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http@master#MaxBytesHandler), a
middleware to protect e.g. against denial-of-service type attacks.

You can [read the blog
post](https://www.klingt.net/articles/go-1-18-with-some-fuzzing-and-a-focus-on-generics.html)
to take a deeper dive.

## Misc

* the influencial [How to become a Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) rev 1.52 notes (2020-01-03):

> Go makes a place as a plausible learning language, displacing Java. [...]

And further:

> A better alternative to Java is to learn Go. This relatively new language is
> pretty easy to move to from Python, and learning it give you a serious leg up
> on the possible next step, which is learning C. Additionally, one of the
> unknowns about the next few years is to what extent Go might actually
> displace C as a systems-programming language. There is a possible future in
> which that happens over much of C's traditional range.

* [sync.Pool](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Pool) helps to reduce GC pressure, by allowing reuse of allocated memory, akin to a [free list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_list)
