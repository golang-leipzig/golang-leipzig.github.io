Hello, 世界!

For virtual [meetup #24](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/277710643/) - scheduled
[2021-12-21, 19:00 CET](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/277710643/) we're inviting
you to test your knowledge of Go. We're planning a fun quiz and we're going
to have a few prizes, too!

As any language, Go has dark corners and
[gotchas](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/gotchas) but also some lesser known
features.

We're lucky to have [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), [About
You](https://www.aboutyou.de/)
([jobs](https://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/jobs/senior-golang-developer)) and
[O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) sponsoring vouchers and books for
this event. Additionally, we are giving away Go pins and posters.


[Join us via Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/ous-mtys-wsx).

Join us to  all things Go and security!

See you!
