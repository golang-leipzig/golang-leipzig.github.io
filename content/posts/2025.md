## 2025 is a wrap

In 2025, a software term again made it to the word of the year in Collins
Dictionary, [vibecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_the_year#Collins_English_Dictionary)
(after "permacrisis" and "AI" in previous years) and probably more code has been
auto-generated (without a "[DO NOT EDIT](https://golang.org/s/generatedcode)") this year than anytime before.

So much indeed, that another term appeared: [comprehension debt](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/09/30/comprehension-debt-the-ticking-time-bomb-of-llm-generated-code/):

> Notably, we identified “comprehension debt” as a novel form of technical
> debt: AI helped us build more sophisticated systems than our skill level
> could independently create, but our insufficient expertise made those systems
> difficult to maintain or modify. This paradox—possessing working systems we
> incompletely understood, created fragility and AI dependency distinct from
> traditional code quality debt. -- [2512.08942](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.08942) (30 Oct 2025)

There is more to code than code, and we had the chance to explore this in
various ways in our meetups in 2025. A quick summary:

* We grew from 695 to [795 members](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) and hosted [nine events](https://golangleipzig.space/tags/summary/) this year. Thanks to [Basislager Coworking](https://basislager.co) for being our home base!
* Thanks also to [CHECK24](https://check24.de) and [GridFuse](https://gridfuse.com) for hosting great events [#49](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-49-wrapup/), [#51](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-51-wrapup/).
* Insights from large scale real world software projects were core to many of our
  events, e.g. [StackRox](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox) (Kubernetes Security) in
[#48](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-48-wrapup/) and
[#51](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-51-wrapup/), [Lightmeter](https://lightmeter.io/)
(YC-W22) in [#50](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-50-wrapup/) or
[OpenCloud](https://opencloud.eu/) in
[#55](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-55-wrapup/).
* We continued to explore the core Go language, for example [memory](https://go.dev/ref/mem) management in [#49](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-49-wrapup/).
* Language models and agents were discussed in [#51](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-51-wrapup/) and [#56](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-56-wrapup/) (all the while focussing on AI that you can actually run yourself).
* Many cool open source projects suitable for self-hosting are implemented in Go - how about running a fast VPN like [headscale](https://headscale.net) yourself ([#51](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-49-wrapup/))?
* In October, we took part in the tenth edition of [GoLab](https://golab.io) [2025](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/golab-2025/) conference in Florence, which
  was a inspiring place to meet lots of Gophers from Italy and around the world. Our contribution was a workshop on [ollama usage and internals](https://github.com/miku/ollamaintro), diving into the internals of a popular LLM runtime.
* Drinkups across the city: [#52](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-52-wrapup/), [#53](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-53-wrapup/), [#54](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-54-wrapup/).

Thanks everyone for joining, let's explore more in 2026!
