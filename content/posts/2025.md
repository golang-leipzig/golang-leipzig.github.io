Our year summarized:

* We grew from 695 to XXX members within a year!
* ...
* In October, we took part in [GoLab](https://golab.io) 2025 in Florence, which
  was a inspiring place to meet lots of Gophers from Italy and around the world and
to learn about interesting projects. Our contribution was a workshop on [ollama
usage and internals](https://github.com/miku/ollamaintro).
* ...
* ...
* As we predicted earlier in [#41](/posts/meetup-41-wrapup/) (2024), 2023 can be seen
  as a "cutoff year" for non-autogenerated content on the web; finally we have some confirmation on this matter:

> We find that in November 2024, the quantity of AI-generated articles being
> published on the web surpassed the quantity of human-written articles. -- [More Articles Are Now Created by AI Than Humans](https://graphite.io/five-percent/more-articles-are-now-created-by-ai-than-humans)

* Our AI usage on this site: We have accumulated about 12 AI generated images
  since around 2022 ([DALL-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e/) was released in
Jan 5, 2021); interestingly, we have not written a single line with any LLM.
LLM texts tend to be shallow, similar to the llm code, that may lack a
signature (and style). *This lack of personality is particularly evident when
comparing human writing to output from large language models. For instance...*

> In 2025, the web is flooded with AI-generated content, but this site remains

Please do not get us wrong, the theory and implementation of deep learning for
various modalities is amazing; some use cases seem irritating (and
somewhat [wasteful](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117)).



Thanks everyone for joining, we hope to [see you again](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) in 2026!
