Hello, 世界!

For meetup #36 on Tuesday [Jun 20, 2023 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666177/) we're thrilled to
welcome [André Eriksson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikssonandre/), founder
of [Encore](https://encore.dev), a startup building the next generation
platform for rapid backend development.

> Building cloud-native backends and distributed systems can involve large
amounts of complexity and repetitive boilerplate.

Encore is a backend development platform and infrastructure SDK designed to
simplify building such backend. Encore provides a declarative approach to
managing cloud infrastructure directly in application code, based on static
analysis. It also helps reduce cloud costs and improve cloud security.

Encore is built in Go (and for Go) and is open-source at
[github.com/encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore). In
the presentation we'll go over the problems it solves, how the developer
experience is like, and how it works under the hood.

Find out more at:

* [encore.dev](https://encore.dev/) ([demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwplIbwJtD0))
* [github.com/encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore) ([example projects](https://github.com/encoredev/examples))

André shared his thoughts on software development, cloud and distributed systems
in an inspiring talk at [Gophercon UK 2021: Software development reimagined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrncUmqSJKU).

We'll meet:

* in person at [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/), [Peterssteinweg 14, 04107 Leipzig](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3504864558)
* and online via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/zht-yuxt-zfo) (please note that we'll plan to record the talk and publish it on youtube)

Join us for a unique opportunity to discuss all things distributed systems,
developer experience, microservices and cloud infrastructure complexities.
Onsite: free drinks!

Extra:

We'll be giving away a paperback copy of [Distributed Services with
Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/) (2021, [4.6 ⭐](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Travis-Jeffery/dp/1680507605))
among the on-site participants.

See you!
