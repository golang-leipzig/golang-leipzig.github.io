Hello, 世界!

For meetup #36 on Tuesday [Jun 20, 2023 19:00 CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666177/) we're thrilled to
welcome [André Eriksson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikssonandre/) from
[encore.dev](https://encore.dev)!

Building cloud-native backends and distributed systems can involve large
amounts of complexity and repetitive boilerplate.

Encore is a backend development platform and infrastructure SDK designed to
simplify building such backend. Encore provides a declarative approach to
managing cloud infrastructure directly in application code, based on static
analysis. It also helps reduce cloud costs and improve cloud security.

Encore is built in Go (and for Go) and is open-source at
[https://github.com/encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore). In
the presentation we'll go over the problems it solves, how the developer
experience is like, and how it works under the hood.

We'll meet

* in person at [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/), [Peterssteinweg 14, 04107 Leipzig](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3504864558)
* and online via [meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers36](https://meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers36) (please note that we'll plan to record the talk)

Join us to discuss all things distributed systems. Onsite: free drinks!

See you!
