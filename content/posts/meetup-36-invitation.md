Hello, 世界!

For meetup #36 on Tuesday [Jun 20, 2023 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666177/) we're thrilled to
welcome [André Eriksson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikssonandre/), software engineer and founder
of [Encore](https://encore.dev), a startup building the next generation
platform for rapid backend development.

> Building cloud-native backends and distributed systems can involve large
amounts of complexity and repetitive boilerplate.

Encore is a backend development platform and infrastructure SDK designed to
simplify building such backend. Encore provides a declarative approach to
managing cloud infrastructure directly in application code, based on static
analysis. It also helps reduce cloud costs and improve cloud security.

Encore is built in Go (and for Go) and is open-source at
[github.com/encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore). In
the presentation we'll go over the problems it solves, how the developer
experience is like, and how it works under the hood.

Find out more at:

* [encore.dev](https://encore.dev/) ([demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwplIbwJtD0))
* [github.com/encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore) ([example projects](https://github.com/encoredev/examples))

André shared his thoughts on software development, cloud and distributed systems
in an inspiring talk at [Gophercon UK 2021: Software development reimagined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrncUmqSJKU).

We'll meet:

* in person at [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/), [Peterssteinweg 14, 04107 Leipzig](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3504864558)
* and online via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/zht-yuxt-zfo) (please note that we'll plan to record the talk and publish it on youtube)

Join us for a unique opportunity to discuss all things distributed systems,
developer experience, microservices and cloud infrastructure complexities.
Onsite: free drinks!

Extra:

We'll be giving away a paperback copy of [Distributed Services with
Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/) (2021, [4.6 ⭐](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Travis-Jeffery/dp/1680507605))
among the on-site participants, courtesy of [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/323592).

See you!

Are you interested in cloud-native development, #microservices and #distributed
system? Do you aim to ship secure and cost-effective cloud-native backends? Do you care about developer experience?

Then please join us at Leipzig #Gophers Meetup #36 on Tue, June 20, 2023 19:00
CEST where we're thrilled to have @AndreErikson from @Encore talking about
simplifying cloud-native backend development and deployment.

Encore provides a declarative approach to managing cloud infrastructure, is built in Go (and for Go) and is open-source.

This is a hybrid (in-person and online) meetup, so you can join us directly via
Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/zht-yuxt-zfo or at @Basislager Leipzig.

We provide free drinks at the event and will be giving away a copy of Distributed Services in Go (https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/), courtesy of @OReillyMedia!
