Hello, 世界!

Meetup #16 will take place Tuesday, [Feb 16,
2021](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/275871222/) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event
page](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/275871222/) or below):

```shell
$ curl -sL https://git.io/Jt0pk | base64 -d
```

We'll have input presentations on the upcoming [Go
1.16](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.16) release and the generics proposal.

As always, other lightning talks or contributions are welcome.

See you!
