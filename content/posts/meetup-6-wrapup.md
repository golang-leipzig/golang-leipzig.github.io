{{< h2 >}}Where to Go?{{< /h2 >}}

The [Berlin Go User Group
celebrates](https://www.meetup.com/golang-users-berlin/) its eighth birthday next
week. Our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) just completed its first Â½ year - so far, we touched upon quite a few
of the [initial topic ideas](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-launched/).

As for [Go conferences](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Conferences), [Golab](https://golab.io/) is an annual international Go
conference, which will have its 4th edition this October. We have two free tickets
for you - if you are interested, [just drop me a line](mailto:martin.czygan@gmail.com).

We'll take a short summer break, and will continue in September 2019. Until
then, enjoy a few references.

Want to improve your Go code? You are just a few steps away with [golangci-lint](github.com/golangci/golangci-lint):

$ cd your/go/project
$ golangci-lint run
...
```

We started a [Go Gotchas

something strange.
