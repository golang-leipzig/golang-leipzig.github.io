Hello, 世界!

Happy 2024! For meetup #40 on Tuesday [Jan 30, 2023 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298481328/) we are thrilled
to have [Bill Kennedy](https://twitter.com/goinggodotnet), Gopher Pioneer and Managing Partner at [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/)
joining us to talk about *Domain Driven, Data Oriented Design*.

Domain driven design has been *tackling complexity in the heart of software*
since Eric Evans' [classic 2003
book](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/search/results?q=Domain-Driven%20Design%3A%20Tackling%20Complexity%20in%20the%20Heart%20of%20Software%20evans),
while emphasizing data in programming has many facets, from [caring about
caches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design), over treating data
as first-class citizen (cf. [Data Oriented
Programming](https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming)) to
design challanges in data-intensive applications (cf.
[DDIA](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)).

We are excited to dive into these topics will Bill!

Join us in person at [Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/) or online
from anywhere with Google Meet:

See you!
