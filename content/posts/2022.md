An [email exchange](https://www.airs.com/blog/archives/559) from November 2009 (a few weeks after the [first presentation on Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnDgT73v8s)):

> It seems to me that these functions [[append, copy](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Appending_and_copying_slices)] are not useful if we figure out a way to
> implement **generics**. Not necessarily a strong argument against them, I
> suppose, but do we want to introduce new builtin functions if we may not need
> them?

About 4500 days and many proposals later, [Go 1.18](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18) is released, including support for [parameterized types](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_parameter_declarations):

> Supporting generics has been Go’s most often requested feature, and we’re
> proud to deliver the generic support that the majority of users need today.
> Subsequent releases will provide additional support for some of the more
> complicated generic use cases

We discussed generics at our first meetup this year: [#25](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-25-wrapup/). A few more things that happened in 2022:

* we organized nine events in 2022
* we grew from 324 to 495 members, our biggest increase to date
* we had an algorithm challenge (mob programming) format in [#27](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-27-wrapup/)
* we collaborated with our friends from [Leipzig Software Craft Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/le-software-craft-community/) and talked about [The state of Go in 2022](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/state-of-go-in-2022/blob/main/Slides.md)
* we collaborated with three startups: [CodeNotary](https://codenotary.com/) ([#30](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-30-wrapup/)), [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/) ([#31](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-31-wrapup/)) and [Gridfuse](https://gridfuse.com/) ([#32](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-32-wrapup/)) and learned about their use of Go for their core products
* we went back to hybrid meetups and offline drinkups ([#29](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-29-invitation/), [#33](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-33-wrapup/))
* we visited various locations: [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/), [Lancaster University](https://www.lancasterleipzig.de/) Campus, [Design Offices Leipzig](https://www.designoffices.de/standorte/buero-mieten-leipzig/leipzig-post), [Soltmann Bar](https://www.soltmann-bar.de/), [Café Cantona](https://www.google.com/search?q=cafe+cantona+leipzig)
* we gave away books from our generous sponsors [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/) and [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/323592) - thank you!
* we [printed postcards](/images/video_2022-12-22_16-47-20_golangleipzig_postcard_unboxing.mp4) with our [cute gopher mascot](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/leipzig-gopher) and disseminated them (and continue to do so) in selected places
* we said *Stop the War* in March 2022 - and we say it again: [Stop the War!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)

Thanks everyone for participating, we hope to [see you again](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) in 2023!
