Hello, 世界!

Meetup #21 will take place Tuesday, [Sep 28,
2021 19:00 CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/275871284/) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event
page](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/275871284/) or below):

* [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81869277732?pwd=ZldmeHp0eWs0N1YyTE94OUo2Z01vdz09](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81869277732?pwd=ZldmeHp0eWs0N1YyTE94OUo2Z01vdz09)

We will have an input presentation by the author of [Concise
Encoding](https://concise-encoding.org/) about the project and its [Go
reference implementation](https://github.com/kstenerud/go-concise-encoding).
Concise encoding is a

> friendly data format for human & machine.

It addresses a modern dilemma:

> Today's data formats present us with a dilemma: Use text based formats that
> are bloated and slow, or use binary formats that humans can't read. Wouldn't
> it be nice to have the benefits of both and the drawbacks of neither?

> Concise Encoding is the next step in the evolution of ad-hoc hierarchical
> data formats, aiming to represent data securely in a power, bandwidth, and
> human friendly way.


Encodings need to balance a lot of tradeoffs between efficiency and ease of use; so
we're glad to hear from the author about some key decisions and how they manifest
themselves in the implementation.
