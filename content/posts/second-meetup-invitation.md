For our [second meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/events/259045114/) tonight, we have two lighting talk proposals:

* Turn data into Go struct - how to easily work with complex XML documents and JSON data with Go
* Glance at the [io package](https://golang.org/pkg/io/) and some io.Reader implementation, that you may not
  have seen before - how to implement your own reader and some examples of
useful (sometimes strange) implementations from existing projects

Please bring your own code, projects, ideas, Go and Cloud-Native questions and let's discuss them. See you there.
