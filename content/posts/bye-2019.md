Thanks everyone for joining our
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) (we currently have 111
members), being curious about Go and for sharing your projects and topics in
2019. We hope you had as much fun as we had.

The future of Go seems bright, the language and ecosystem being so
[versatile](https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10597-tamago_-_bare_metal_go_framework_for_arm_socs),
[cloud-friendly](https://thenewstack.io/go-the-programming-language-of-the-cloud/)
and [popular](https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2019/3).

Let's explore this future together in 2020!
