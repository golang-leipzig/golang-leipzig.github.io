{{% h2 %}}TL;DR{{% /h2 %}}

We will reshuffle meetups a bit: We will split the current [Go and Cloud Native
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/) up, into a Go
focussed meetup (we will keep the Meetup group, just rename it) and a dedicated
Cloud Native Meetup - which will most likely be merged with the growing
[Linux Meetup Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Linux-Meetup-Leipzig/).

If you have not attended [Linux Meetup
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Linux-Meetup-Leipzig/) yet and your are
interested in Enterprise Linux and Cloud Native topics, please join. It's
awesome.

{{% h2 %}}Background{{% /h2 %}}

We started the Go meetup in February 2019 jointly with a Cloud Native label,
since a lot of Cloud Native tools are actually written in Go. Also, if you
write software, that lives in the Cloud, you might evaluate Go as well.  Hence,
the joint meetup seemed to make sense to us then.

However, in the past year, we had more Go language related topics; at the same
time the Linux Meetup Leipzig hosted lots of Cloud Native talks, from container
runtimes to Cloud Native applications like Kubeflow.

And there are people who want to learn about Cloud Native only, not Go. Hence,
the meetup split seems to make sense now. It will allow for a sharper focus.

In any case, we are happy to contribute to a growing set of interesting
developer meetups in Leipzig, with
[Go](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/),
[Linux](https://www.meetup.com/Linux-Meetup-Leipzig/) (Cloud Native),
[Softwerkskammer Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Softwerkskammer-Leipzig/) or
[Google Developer Group](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Leipzig/) being just a few
of them.

It will take a few weeks to rename all our sites and groups, but the process
should be done be end of October 2019.
