In [Meetup #4](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-4-wrapup/) we learned
about a Go project using the Lightning Network. Many more projects in the
Cryptocurrenty space use Go, such
[filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin), [subprojects from
sia](https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs) and many more.

If you are excited about these technologies, why not attend the
Decentralized Storage Summit at TU Berlin on Friday, August 23, 2019?

Here's a link to a discount code to get in for free:
