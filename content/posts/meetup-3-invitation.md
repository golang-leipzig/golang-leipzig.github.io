[Meetup #3](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/events/260338152/)
is scheduled for Friday, April 12, 2019, 19:00 CEST at
[Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/).

We will take a closer look at [Go
modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for dependency management.
We also have one potential proposal for a lightning talk with the cryptic title
"Ramen Linux".

As always, please bring your own code, projects, ideas, Go and Cloud Native questions and let's discuss them. See you there.
