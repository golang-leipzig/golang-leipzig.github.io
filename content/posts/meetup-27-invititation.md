Hello, 世界!

For [meetup #27](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/285798083/) &mdash; on May 10, 2022 19:00 CEST &mdash; we'll have an interactive coding session around [Go generics](https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics).

We start with a problem and will develop two versions, one with and one without generics.

For a refresher on Generics see:
