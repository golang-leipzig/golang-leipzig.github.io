Thanks everyone for joining our
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) (we currently have 194
members), connecting, sharing experiences and projects in 2020. A positive
side-effect of remote meetups is that people join from all over the world - we
were happy to have people tuning in from South America and Asia this year.

We expect a remote only meetup for the foreseeable future. So far we fixed six
dates for 2021, and they will all be on Tuesdays this
year. We might add more dates as we go along.

Finally, we have a new, charming, unique Gopher-Lion mascot - thanks
[Andreas](https://www.klingt.net/) for bringing it alive!
