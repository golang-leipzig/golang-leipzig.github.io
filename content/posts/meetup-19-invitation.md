Hello, 世界!

Meetup #19 will take place Tuesday, [Jun 22,
2021 19:00 CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/275871279) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event

* [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84547890514?pwd=eXIzdXU2RGJmWmw4NzVjb0VMazZxZz09](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84547890514?pwd=eXIzdXU2RGJmWmw4NzVjb0VMazZxZz09)

We'll have an input presentation about a
[core](https://www.mgasch.com/2021/01/listwatch-part-1/) distributed systems
project: [etcd](https://etcd.io/).

> etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a
reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or
cluster of machines.

Originally developed by CoreOS (Container Linux) etcd is used today as a key
building block in many cloud applications, such as Kubernetes.

Join us to learn and discuss all things Go - and etcd!

See you!
