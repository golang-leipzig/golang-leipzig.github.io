> etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a
reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or
cluster of machines.

Originally inspired by
[Chubby](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf)
(2006) and developed by
[CoreOS](http://web.archive.org/web/20130805052834/http://coreos.com/)
(Container Linux) etcd is used today as a key building block in many cloud
applications, such as Kubernetes.

Join us to learn and discuss all things Go - and etcd!

See you!
