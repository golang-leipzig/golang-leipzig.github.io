Hello, 世界!

We would like to invite you to a special hackathon event this year: [Hackolaus #2](https://hackolaus.de/).

> When the nights get longer and the weather outside is frightful, we need
some warmth in our hearts. Many people sacrifice their time and energy to
create this warmth by giving and contributing to the benefit of those less
fortunate and in need.

> Many NGOs, associations and individuals also work hard to give to social,
environmental or other sustainability causes. We believe that they should not
only give but also receive, that society should give back to them.

> This is why we are collaborating on a hackathon to support these organizations
with solutions to help them focus more on delivering impact.
