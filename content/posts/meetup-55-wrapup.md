OpenCloud is a widely deployed OpenCloud cloud storage and collaboration
platform built on a microservices architecture. It scales from homelab
installations to large clusters with millions of users.

Some highlights from the presentation:

* [reva](https://reva.link/) is a CERN storage interop layer and is also where opencloud story started

> Reva is an interoperability platform consisting of several daemons written in
> Go. It acts as bridge between high-level clients (mobile, web, desktop) and
> the underlying storage (CephFS,
> [EOS](https://eos-docs.web.cern.ch/diopside/introduction/index.html), local
> filesytems). It exports well-known APIs, like WebDAV, to faciliate access
> from these devices. It also exports a high-performance gRPC API, codenamed
> CS3 APIs, to easily integrate with other systems. Reva is meant to be a high
> performant and customizable HTTP and gRPC server. --
