Hello, 世界!

Meetup #11 will take place on [Friday, May 15, 2020 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785545/) and will most
likely be virtual again (we will share the zoom link here and on the meetup
event page).

This time, we're excited to look at software *built with Go*. Our main topic
will be the cloud native machine learning toolkit:
[kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/).

# Kubeflow - A follow up

Leveraging [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for Data Science purposes is
still a burden for many users these days. The integration of large
infrastructures into Data Science workflows seems not quite solved.

In this talk [Sascha](https://github.com/saschagrunert) and [Markus](https://github.com/mbu93) will follow-up on their previous blog
post ["Kubeflow: Data Science on Steroids"](https://github.com/saschagrunert/kubeflow-data-science-on-steroids). They will check-out what has
changed in the past year and how certain features have evolved in Kubeflow. To
do so they will revisit possible deployment variants of Kubeflow and look under
the hood of the application stack to explore why choosing Kubernetes for Data
Science is a great idea.

On top of that they will demonstrate advanced topics like hyperparameter tuning
with [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib) and Tensorflow model serving.

Interested and want to hear more? Join the Meetup!
