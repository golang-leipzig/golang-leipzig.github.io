Hello, 世界!

For meetup #41 on Tuesday [Feb 27, 2024 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298066352) we'll have a
lightning talk on [milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), a [vector
database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) written in Go. Words
and documents have been represented as vectors for a long time, and the [Vector
Space Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model) has been a
robust foundation many information retrieval systems.

While continuous representations have been research since the
[1980s](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/pdp3.pdf), the original
[word2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf)
([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6216044)) paper from 2013
paved the way to contemporary industrial applications of word (and other)
embeddings.

This lightning talk continues to highlight tools written in Go in the "AI" domain (in
[#38](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-38-wrapup/), among other things, we looked at [local models](https://github.com/miku/localmodels) with [ollama](https://ollama.com/)).

Additionally, we'll discuss what's new in [Go 1.22](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.22).

You can join us in person at [Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/) (free drinks)
or remotely via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/dmu-zsyj-eqh) (BYOD).

See you!
