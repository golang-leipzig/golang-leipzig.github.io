## Confidential Computing with Go

Confidential computing is a new security paradigm that protects data not only
at rest or in transit but also in use. A hardware-based trusted execution
environment provides an isolated area, a secure enclave within a CPU, that
protects sensitive data while being processed.

Until recently, confidential computing frameworks were mostly restricted to
C/C++ with a significantly reduced system interface. To make confidential
computing more accessible and use it in cloud-native contexts, we created EGo.
EGo is an open-source framework that enables users to build, debug, and run
confidential apps with Go.

In this talk, I’ll give a brief introduction to confidential computing and show
why Go is a great fit for it. I’ll present the architecture design of EGo and
how you can easily build your own confidential apps. Finally, I’ll share some
hands-on examples and use cases.
