## OpenCloud

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #55 on Tuesday [Oct 28, 2025 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/leipzig-golang/events/305626267/) at
[Basislager Leipzig](https://basislager.co) we are thrilled to welcome [Klaas
Freitag](https://www.linkedin.com/in/klaasf/) (CTO) from
[OpenCloud](https://opencloud.eu).

> OpenCloud is an open-source project that gives you a secure and private way
> to store, access, and share your files. -- [GitHub:
> OpenCloud](https://github.com/opencloud-eu)

Formerly knows as ownCloud, OpenCloud components were co-developed at CERN and
a large community of active contributors.

> [OpenCloud] is based on a fork of the open source software ‘ownCloud Infinite
> Scale’ (OCIS), whose components were co-developed by developers from the
> science organisation CERN and other active participants. OpenCloud is now
> being further developed with new ideas and in the spirit of a reliable open
> source community and published under the Apache 2.0 and AGPL-3.0 licences.

The core OpenCloud backend is written in Go and available at
[opencloud-eu/opencloud](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud) (a few
years ago, the backend was [ported from PHP to
Go](https://www.heise.de/news/Mehr-Tempo-mit-Go-statt-PHP-ownCloud-Infinite-Scale-ist-einsatzbereit-7364770.html)).

We will hear about the architecture of the backend system and will have
opportunity to explore and discuss the challenges of large scale storage
systems.

More background on the project can also be found on recordings from
[CS3](https://www.cs3community.org/) (Cloud Storage, Synchronization and
Sharing) at [TU
München](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/latest-news/events-overview/event/cs3-2025-cloud-storage-synchronization-and-sharing.html):
