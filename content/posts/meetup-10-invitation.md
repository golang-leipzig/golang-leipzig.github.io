Hello, 世界!

The global [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)
puts limitations on all aspects of societal life. During our last meetup, [two
people were
infected](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/styles/is_large/public/images/novel-coronavirus-cases-EU-UK-29-03-2020%20.jpg.png) in Germany,
as of this announcement, we are at
[57.298](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html).

The Go community addresses resulting issues in a [blogpost on the pandemic](https://blog.golang.org/pandemic).

For [Meetup #10 on Friday, April 17,
2020](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785531/), we still would
like to bring people together, in form of a shorter, virtual meetup.

We may use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) for
videoconferencing. If you have other useful tools, just [drop us a
line](mailto:martin.czygan@gmail.com).

Given probable limitation of the medium, we do not plan to have any long
presentation, but instead would be more interested in the following:

* Do you work remotely - if so, how do you manage the situation?
* What tools you find useful for development, communication or collaboration?

And apart from these things, maybe people want to share some of Go projects
they use or they are working on via screen sharing? That would actually be
super cool!

Anyway, we hope you are fine, given the circumstances. Virtual meetup link
follows a few days before the meetup, see you then!

PS. Up until at least 2020-05-31, we host an own videoconference server under
[jitsi.cc](https://jitsi.cc/).
