In 2023 [large language
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) and [generative
AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) captured
many minds - fewer know that the official Go repository included code
to train a statistical language [model](https://go.dev/doc/codewalk/markov/) (and to respond to prefixes) since [Aug 17,
2011](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/2a189845b619ec27772d4b21d2a3cb9e27d5fbb8), which is based on chapter 3.1 from [The Practice of
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_of_Programming) (1999),
which in turn took inspiration from [Dewdney, A. K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Dewdney#Computing,_mathematics,_and_science). (1989), [COMPUTER
RECREATIONS. Scientific American, 260(6), 122â€“125](https://archive.org/details/ComputerRecreationsMarkovChainer) (the trace follows further to [Shannon](https://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/rome/refs/shannon_51.pdf), 1951 and [Markov](http://www.alpha60.de/research/markov/DavidLink_AnExampleOfStatistical_MarkovTrans_2007.pdf), 1913)

What else happened?

* we organized six [events](https://golangleipzig.space/tags/summary/) in 2023 and grew from 495 to [578 members](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/)
* we covered Go 1.20 in [#34](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-34-wrapup/) and kept discussing new developments (like [slog](https://go.dev/blog/slog), [enhanced ServeMux routing](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61410), ...) in Go throughout the year
* we collaborated with cloud startup [encore.dev](https://encore.dev) for
  [#36](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-36-wrapup/) ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYEXDmy3zUA)) and [CHECK24](https://check24.de), which was a wonderful meetup host for
[#38](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-38-wrapup/) - thanks for your contributions!
* we participated in [Chemnitz Linux Days](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/clt23/) and did a presentation on [Sustainability and security in the Go ecosystem](https://github.com/miku/goeco)
* AI sneaked into our events in
  [#35](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-35-wrapup/) and
[#38](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-38-wrapup/) where we used C/GO
to interface with [ggml](http://ggml.ai/) and [tried out](https://github.com/miku/localmodels)
[ollama](https://ollama.ai/), respectively - a total of four ([here](https://golangleipzig.space/images/578575.gif) and
[here](https://golangleipzig.space/meetup-38-llm-haiku/meetup-38-llm-haiku.pdf))
computer-generated haikus have been recorded (we used CPUs and local models only)
* we brought together people from various backgrounds and hope to do more of that in 2024!

Thanks everyone for joining, we hope to [see you again](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) in 2024!
