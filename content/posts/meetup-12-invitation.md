We have a talk about HTTP proxies. You'll discover one
[CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5386) you never heard of and we
see what the author of curl says [on
SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62722430/why-does-curl-send-a-proxy-connection-header-even-though-the-rfc-seems-to-disco),
why curl does not strictly follow the HTTP RFC.

**UPDATE** We accidentally posted the wrong link, [here you go](http://meet.uni-leipzig.de/b/czy-6pa-37k).

See you!
