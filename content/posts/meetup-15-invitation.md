Hello, 世界!

Meetup #15 will take place today [Dec 18,
2020](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785606/) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event
page](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785606/) or below):

```shell
$ curl -sL https://git.io/JLBe8 | base64 -d
```

We'll have two input presentations:

1. On a [WaitGroup](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup) wrapper, including testing strategies.
2. On a tiny library - [parallel](https://github.com/miku/parallel) that allows to write parallel filters fast.

As always, other lightning talks or contributions are welcome.

See you!

PS. And if you cannot join us today, thanks for visiting us in 2020! Merry Christmas, Gophers!
