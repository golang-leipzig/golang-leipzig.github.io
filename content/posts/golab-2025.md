## GOLAB 2025

Since 2015, [Develer](https://www.develer.com) has been [organizing](https://golab.io/about-us) one of the
best Go conferences on the continent: [GOLAB](https://golab.io/) - bringing
together the international and Italian Go developer community in the beautiful
city of [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence).

Happy 10th birthday, GOLAB!

Thoughtfulness in environmental stewardship and social responsibility continues
with GoLab 2025 through their [GoLab for the
Planet](https://golab.io/golab-for-the-planet) initiative.
