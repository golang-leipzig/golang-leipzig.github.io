## CLT23

We briefly presented at the annual
[Chemnitz Linux Days](https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2023/en/programm/vortraege) conference
on 2023-03-11. The topics was [Sustainability and Security in the Go
ecosystem](https://github.com/miku/goeco), collecting a few thoughts starting from the ACM Queue article [Surviving Software Dependencies](https://doi.org/10.1145/3329781.3344149) (2019).

Keywords: security, data breach, dependency management, distributed package management, [OSV](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/), vulnerability scanning

We prepared a demo for the vanity URL import supported by Go package system - check out: [clt23](https://golangleipzig.space/clt23/) or try:

```
$ go install golangleipzig.space/clt23@latest
$ clt23
```

CLT is a nice event to learn and connect with people from the open source community.
