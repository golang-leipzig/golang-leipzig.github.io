Our year summarized:

* we organized eight [events](https://golangleipzig.space/tags/summary/) in
  2024, plus seven open [tech
lunches](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/go-tech-lunch-dates-2024/) and grew
from 577 to [695 members](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) - big üôè to
[Basislager Coworking](https://basislager.co) for providing a great venue for
most of our events ([#40](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-40-wrapup),
[#41](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-41-wrapup),
[#44](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-44-wrapup),
[#46](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-46-wrapup))
* we collaborated with two local companies again: [Gridfuse](https://gridfuse.com) ([#43](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-43-wrapup/)) and
  [CHECK24](https://check24.de) ([#42](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-42-wrapup/), [#45](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-45-wrapup/)) &mdash; thanks for being such great hosts!
* [Bill Kennedy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-kennedy-5b318778/) from [Ardan Labs](https://ardanlabs.com) kicked off our year with a presentation on data-oriented [DDD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_Design) in [#40](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-40-wrapup/)
* we had many cool demos of open source tools by their authors this year:
[ekstatic](https://github.com/Metamogul/ekstatic),
[gocoverageplus](https://github.com/Fabianexe/gocoverageplus),
[timestone](https://github.com/Metamogul/timestone),
[go-journald-exporter](https://gitlab.com/leandrosansilva/go-journald-exporter),
[gh-workflow-stats-action](https://github.com/neondatabase/gh-workflow-stats-action/)
plus lots of nice everyday utilities and techniques people shared in
[#44](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-44-wrapup/)
* Performance played a role: [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) and [1BRC](https://1brc.dev) (1 Billion Row Challenge) were discussed in
  [#42](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-42-wrapup/) and we turned
the 1BRC into a workshop for the international
[GOLAB](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/golab-2024/) conference in Florence, Italy: [Exercises in
performance optimizations](https://github.com/miku/expo) --
[SWAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAR) was one of the cute,
[old](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/multiple-byte.pdf) techniques used
to crunchs through 1B rows in a matter of seconds
