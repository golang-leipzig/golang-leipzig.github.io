Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå!

For meetup #38 on Tuesday [Nov 21, 2023 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666185/) we're excited to
collaborate with [CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/), which will host this
meetup at their Leipzig office, located at [Tr√∂ndlinring 3, 04105
Leipzig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6). CHECK24 uses Go in
production at scale.

We're having two presentations:

* Fabian will present about a Go project developed at CHECK24
* Martin (Leipzig Gophers) will give a lightning talk about running and using large-language models ([LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)) locally with the help of Go tools (following up on some topics discussed in [#35](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-35-wrapup/))

We'll meet:

* in person at [CHECK24 Leipzig Office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6), [Tr√∂ndlinring 3, 04105 Leipzig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6) -- directions provided at the entrance
* and online via [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers38)

Join us for a unique opportunity to discuss Go in production at scale!

Note: By attending this event you agree to be photographed.

See you!

PS: Free drinks and üçï!
