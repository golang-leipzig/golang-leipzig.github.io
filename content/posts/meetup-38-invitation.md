Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå!

For meetup #38 on Tuesday [Nov 21, 2023 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666185/) we're excited to
collaborate with [CHECK24](https://www.check24.de/), which will host this
meetup at their Leipzig office, located at [Tr√∂ndlinring 3, 04105
Leipzig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6). CHECK24 uses Go in
production at scale.

We're having two presentations:

* Fabian will present about a Go project developed at CHECK24
* Martin (Leipzig Gophers) will present about running and using large-language models ([LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)) locally with the help of Go tools (following up on some topics discussed in [#35](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-35-wrapup/))

We'll meet:

* in person at [CHECK24 Leipzig Office](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6), [Tr√∂ndlinring 3, 04105 Leipzig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWKDzUNSYuHcRCew6) -- directions provided at the entrance
* and online via [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers38)

Join us for a unique opportunity to discuss Go in production at scale!

See you!

PS: Free drinks and üçï!

Are you interested in cloud-native development, #microservices and #distributed
system? Do you aim to ship secure and cost-effective cloud-native backends? Do you care about developer experience?

Then please join us at Leipzig #Gophers Meetup #36 on Tue, June 20, 2023 19:00
CEST where we're thrilled to have @AndreErikson from @Encore talking about
simplifying cloud-native backend development and deployment.

Encore provides a declarative approach to managing cloud infrastructure, is built in Go (and for Go) and is open-source.

This is a hybrid (in-person and online) meetup, so you can join us directly via
Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/zht-yuxt-zfo or at @Basislager Leipzig.

We provide free drinks at the event and will be giving away a copy of Distributed Services in Go (https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/), courtesy of @OReillyMedia!
