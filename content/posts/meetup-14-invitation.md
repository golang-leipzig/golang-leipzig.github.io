Hello, 世界!

Meetup #14 will take place [Nov 13,
2020](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785591/) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event
page](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785591/) or below):

```shell
$ curl -sL git.io/JkIVG | base64 -d
```

We will have a input presentation on file embedding - a popular technique to
make deployments and workflows easier. Many tools exists today, as can be seen
in [#35950](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35950). Have you ever wondered,
which of these to use? Thanksfully, [klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet)
shed some light on this and we'll learn about the ups and downs of a few tools
and also what it would take to write one yourself.

As always, other lightning talks or contributions are welcome.

See you!
