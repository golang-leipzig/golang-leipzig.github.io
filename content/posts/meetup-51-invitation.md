## Summer vibes

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #51 on Tuesday [May 27, 2025 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/305626253) at
[Gridfuse](https://gridfuse.com) we have a short talk/experience report by
[Martin Czygan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-czygan-58348842/) on using
large language models for writing and editing Go (and other) code.

> Beyond Benchmarks: Human x LLM for Go and other code (intermediate report)

> Writing a prompt is like researching a model. Since 01/2025 I have been
> conducting a self-experiment trying to integrate various LLMs into Go
> software development (and also other languages), with mixed results. This short
> talk gives a summary with examples, findings, hits and misses.

We may have time for other lightning talks as well.
