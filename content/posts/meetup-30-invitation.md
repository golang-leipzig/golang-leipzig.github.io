Hello, 世界!

## immudb

For [meetup #30](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/286871365/)
&mdash; on Sep 20, 2022 19:00 CEST &mdash; we're thrilled to welcome [Dennis
Zimmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denniszimmer) and [Bartłomiej
Święcki](https://github.com/byo) from [Codenotary](https://codenotary.com/),
who will talk about their open source database project
[immudb](https://immudb.io/).

[![](/images/immudb-mascot-small-30.png)](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb)

> immudb is a ledger database that has been developed with performance,
> scalability and versatility in mind [...]

> Data stored in immudb is cryptographically coherent and verifiable. Unlike
> blockchains, immudb can handle millions of transactions per second, and can
> be used both as a lightweight service or embedded in your application as a
> library. immudb runs everywhere, on an IoT device, your notebook, a server,
> on-premise or in the cloud.

Also check out Bartłomiej's talk at FOSDEM 2022: [Don't trust us, trust the
math behind immudb: How immudb protects safety critical
data](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/safety_dont_trust_us_trust_the_math_behind_immudb/).

To quote [Pat Helland](https://twitter.com/pathelland) in [Immutability Changes Everything](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf) (2015):

> There is an inexorable trend towards storing and sending immutable data. We
> need immutability to coordinate at a distance and we can afford immutability,
> as storage gets cheaper.
