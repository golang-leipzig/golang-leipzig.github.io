Hello, 世界!

For meetup #44 on Tuesday [Sep 24, 2024 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298066362/) we'll
showcase daily development tools.

In this format we'll exchange our favorite tools to do our development tasks, including

 - **Your favorite software tools** that streamline your coding process.
 - **Custom scripts or functions** you’ve written to automate repetitive tasks.
 - **Any hardware or desk setup** that boosts your productivity.
 - **Even non-technical items** that contribute to your coding routine are welcome!

This is intended to be casual and everyone is welcomed to share their tool, no matter how small or big it is.

You can join us in person at [Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/)
or remotely via [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers44) (BYOD).

See you!
