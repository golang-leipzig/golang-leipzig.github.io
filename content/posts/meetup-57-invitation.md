## Go^(4 perf) + JS + WASM = OnlyOffice Nonlinear Programming (NLP) Solver Plugin

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #57 on Tuesday [Jan 27, 2026 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/312537678) we welcome [Karl
Breuer](https://karlbreuer.com), who will showcase an [OnlyOffice
plugin](https://github.com/Karl1b/only-office-nlp-solver) for nonlinear
programming, that uses Go via WASM for performance.

Linear programming (LP) optimizes problems where all relationships are straight
lines (making them efficiently solvable), while nonlinear programming (NLP)
handles curved relationships and complex constraints, which is computationally
harder, and performance is key.

We may have a second lightning talk on a [charm](https://charm.land/) based TUI
for interacting with the *Advanced Open-Source Enterprise Wiki* software
[xwiki](https://www.xwiki.org/) (a project, which started at a vibecoding
contest in [Dec 2025](https://events.scads.ai/event/121/) and won a 🥉).


### Schedule

* 18:45 Doors open
* 19:00 Welcome
* 19:10 OnlyOffice NLP Plugin
* 19:45 LT: xwiki TUI
* 19:50 Open discussion


We'll meet:

* in person at [Basislager Leipzig](https://basislager.co), at [Peterssteinweg 14, 04107 Leipzig](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1fMkeDSPZ7Aauszh8) ([OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3504864558))
* and online via [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/LeipzigGophers57)

Join us to discuss all things hand-crafted or generated Go.
