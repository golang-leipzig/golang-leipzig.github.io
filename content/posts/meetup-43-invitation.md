Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå!

For meetup #43 on Tuesday [May 28, 2024 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/298066360/) we are thrilled
to collaborate again with [Gridfuse](https://gridfuse.com), a renewable energy
startup in the heart of Leipzig with the mission to *help deliver a world where
renewable energy sources become the main source of power on the global grid*.

> By fusing together multiple individual renewable sources through software and
> intelligent algorithms, we unite them into a force that can transform our
> global energy system. -- [Gridfuse](https://gridfuse.com/)

We will have a presentation about a core computational topic with broad applications - [finite state machines]().

**Ekstatic ‚Äì a minimal state machine library**

How do you model a state-machine-based workflow in Go? Even though there are
various [FSM](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/finiteStateMachine.html)
implementations available, they suffer from different shortcomings.  This
presentation will introduce a minimalistic go library for defining
(non-)deterministic state machines, that aims to be as simple as powerful and
idiomatic. The following discussion gives room for questions and to explore
benefits, drawbacks, and potential alternatives.

* and online via [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/rxp-dbzd-dex)

Join us for an evening dive into Go, computation and energy.
