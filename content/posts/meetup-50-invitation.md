## Reflection and Reconciliation

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #50 on Tuesday [Apr 29, 2025 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/306803728/) at [Basislager
Coworking](https://basislager.co) we are thrilled to have two input
presentations:

* [Leandro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrosansilva/) will reflect on a
  recent [software project](https://gitlab.com/leandrosansilva/controlcenter) of his, written in Go, that provides [smart postfix
monitoring](https://controlcenter.app/). The project was part of the [YC-W22
batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lightmeter) ([blog](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/meet-the-yc-winter-2022-batch)). The title of his
talk will be:

> How a Go project dies; lessons learned, challenges to revive it and the scars I got on the way

This will be a great mix of technical and non-technical aspects of building
software projects.
* [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-b%C3%A4umer-a61042177/)
  will take another closer look at
[StackRox](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox), the Kubernetes Security
platform. He'll be talking about the client-server protocol between the
StackRox server and its agent and discuss how to maintain backwards
compatibility, manage multiple event streams from clusters and how the
authentication works.

Join us for retrospectives and real-world software project insights!
