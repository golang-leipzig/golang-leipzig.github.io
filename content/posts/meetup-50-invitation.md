## Reflection and Reconciliation

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #50 on Tuesday [Apr 29, 2025 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/306803728/) at
[Basislager Coworking](https://basislager.co) we are happy to have two great inputs:

* [Leandro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrosansilva/) will reflect on a
  recent software project of his, written in Go, that provides [smart postfix
monitoring](https://controlcenter.app/). The project was part of the [YC-W22
batch](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lightmeter). The title of his
project will be: *How a Go project dies; lessons learned, challenges to revive
it and the scars I got on the way* - this will be a great mix of technical and
non-technical aspects of building software projects.
* [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-b%C3%A4umer-a61042177/) (ex-RedHat)
  will take another closer look at
[StackRox](https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox), the Kubernetes Security
platform. He'll be talking about the client-server protocol between the
StackRox server and its agent and discuss how to maintain backwards
compatibility, manage multiple event streams from clusters and how the
authentication works.

Join us for retrospectives and learnings from real-world software projects!
