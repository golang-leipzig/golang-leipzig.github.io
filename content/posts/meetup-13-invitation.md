Hello, 世界!

Meetup #13 will take place today, [Friday Oct 16, 2020 19:00
CEST](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785569/) and will be
virtual again. We'll use Zoom (find the link on [the event
page](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/events/268785569/) or below):

```

We have a short talk on [seaweedfs](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs), a
key value store written in Go and inspired by the [Facebook
Haystack](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf)
paper (back when FB only had 20PB of image data).

Beyond a key-value store seaweedfs offers various storage access methods on
top, e.g. an S3 API, which makes shifting between on premise and cloud storage
easy.

As always, other lightning talks or contributions are welcome.

See you!
