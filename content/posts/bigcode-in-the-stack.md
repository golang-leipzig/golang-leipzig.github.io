## In the Stack

The AI space develops fast, with one cornerstone being open datasets available
for training. Code from [golang-leipzig](https://github.com/golang-leipzig) is
part of [The Stack](https://www.bigcode-project.org/docs/about/the-stack/) ([20 Nov 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15533)):

> a 6.4 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 358 programming
> languages.

Five of our repositories are included in the [25.74 GB of source code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06161.pdf#page=7) (in
4,730,461 files) written in Go included in this dataset.

Transparency is a key factor in the development of datasets and derived models.
