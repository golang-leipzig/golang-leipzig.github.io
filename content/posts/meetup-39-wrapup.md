## Drinkup notes

Meetup #39 took place
[2023-12-19](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/290666187/) at
[Cantona Leipzig](https://www.google.com/search?q=cantona+leipzig) and these
were just some of the talking points.

* without extra libraries, schema validation in JSON is minimalistic (e.g. [json schema](https://json-schema.org/)); could [cue](https://cuelang.org/docs/usecases/validation/) help?
* [malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/) is an experimental data modeling language over relational stores
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) is a nice shell helper for 12-factor-style appu
* time is not just a line, it's [bound](https://github.com/aws/clock-bound) (cf. [chrony](https://chrony-project.org/))
* test your latencies: [aws](https://aws-latency-test.com/), [gcp](https://gcping.com/), or just the [internet](http://gfblip.appspot.com/)
* eventbridge/kubernetes at [serverless office hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQjNZxo1TO0)
* interesting, dedicated code assistant for ansible: [Ansible Lightspeed](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/ansible-lightspeed)

Next year will probably bring yet another wave of hyper-focussed LLM-based code
comprehension tools (beside hyper-focussed niche, local, custom-trained LLMs
for dedicated tasks, in general).

## Happy holidays!
