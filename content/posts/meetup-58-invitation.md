## Beads

Hello, 世界!

For meetup #58 on Tuesday [Mar 31, 2026 19:00
CET](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-golang/events/312537698/) we are happy to
have [Akim Zmerli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akimzmerli/) give us an intro to
[beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), which is

> a memory upgrade for your coding agent

[Agentic coding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11126) without memory can feel like:

> Imagine a software project staffed by engineers working in shifts, where each
> new engineer arrives with no memory of what happened on the previous shift. -- [Effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)

The beads project is less than six month old (2025-10-11), but already well beyond
250KLOC, with more than 200KLOC written in Go.

We are always interested in developer tools. At
[#44](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-44-wrapup/), less than two years
ago, not a single AI coding tool did make it to [our
list](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-44-wrapup/).

Looking forward to a futuristic evening.
