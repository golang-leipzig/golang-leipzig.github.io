We keep this short, as there would be too many interesting things to mention that come up, if curious and fun people meet.

Just to name a few things:

* [Cue](https://cuelang.org/)
* [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) (JS)

A couple of people had distant memories of
[Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), which also [influenced
Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#ancestors) e.g.  in
[declarations](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Variable#declaration) or conditions
without [parentheses](https://wiki.freepascal.org/IF).

Many people use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go) or
[vim](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go), but there are also some dedicated Go
IDEs, e.g. [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) or [liteide](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide):

> LiteIDE is a simple, open source, cross-platform Go IDE.

A lot more topics were discusses, so [join our
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang) to get notified of upcoming
events!
