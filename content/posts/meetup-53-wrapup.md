* running CI locally, e.g. with [GL runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/), or [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
* challenges of system designs that include language models or related technologies: levels or randomness (LLM parameters, temperature, ...)

> However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and
> weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results
> suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures
> get higher. -- [Is Temperature the Creativity Parameter of Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00492)

Randomness in embeddings: Do you get different embedding vectors from the same model on the same input?

> discipline, confidence, rigor, and many years of practice.
