## File Embedding

We had a great [input
presentation](https://github.com/golang-leipzig/file-embedding) on file
embedding, which allows to ship additional files within a binary.

How do you put files into a binary? There a [numerous
tools](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/draft-embed.md#background),
some of them limited, some of them with large feature sets.

Is it time for *Yet Another File Embedding Tool*? Yes!

That such a tool can be simple and easy to use is shown by
[klingtnet/embed](https://github.com/klingtnet/embed).

## Misc

* [awsls](https://github.com/jckuester/awsls) is a tool that uses code
  generation to simplify AWS command line interactions
* we side-tracked into note-taking, and found out that people use all kinds of
  journal software, from OneNote, plain text files, custom software and plain
paper notebooks
