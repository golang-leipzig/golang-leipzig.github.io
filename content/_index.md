We're starting a [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Cloud
Native](https://www.cncf.io/) [Meetup in
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/). The first event
took place at [Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/), Friday, 8th of
February 2019, 19:00 - we had an interesting mix of people, novice to
experienced users of Go, various polyglot developers, cluster admins and
devops people. A list of themes discussed at the event is currently being
processed in preparation for the next meetup, scheduled for March 2019. [See
you there](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud)!

Our goal is to establish a place, where people from all backgrounds interested
in the Go programming language and various cloud technologies can meet, learn,
share experiences, present, discuss and network.

Initial organizers are [miku](https://github.com/miku/),
[klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet),
[panzerdev](https://github.com/panzerdev) and
[dataduke](https://github.com/dataduke), and we are inviting everyone to
contribute or participate.
