We're starting a [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Cloud
Native](https://www.cncf.io/) [Meetup in
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/). The [first
event](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/meetup-launched/) took place at
[Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/), Friday, 8th of February 2019,
19:00 - we had an interesting mix of people, novice to experienced users of Go,
various polyglot developers, cluster admins and devops people. Our next meetup is
scheduled for [Friday, March, 15
2019](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/events/259045114/) and we are
currently [collecting
ideas](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/second-meetup-call-for-input/). [See
you there](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/events/259045114/)!

Our goal is to establish a place, where people from all backgrounds interested
in the Go programming language and various cloud technologies can meet, learn,
share experiences, present, discuss and network.

Initial organizers are [miku](https://github.com/miku/),
[klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet),
[panzerdev](https://github.com/panzerdev) and
[dataduke](https://github.com/dataduke), and we are inviting everyone to
contribute or participate.
