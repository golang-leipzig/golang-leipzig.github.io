title: "Go and Cloud Native Meetup Leipzig"
draft: false
---

We're starting a [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Cloud
Native](https://www.cncf.io/) [Meetup in
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/). For 2019 we plan to
host one meetup per month. The next event is scheduled for May 2019.

Our goal is to establish a place, where people from all backgrounds interested
in the Go programming language (golang) and various cloud technologies can meet, learn,
share experiences, present, discuss and network.

Initial organizers are [miku](https://github.com/miku/),
[klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet),
[panzerdev](https://github.com/panzerdev) and
[dataduke](https://github.com/dataduke), and we are inviting everyone to
contribute or participate.
