title: "Golang and Cloud Native Meetup Leipzig"
draft: false
---

We're starting a [Golang](https://golang.org/) and [Cloud
Native](https://www.cncf.io/) [Meetup in
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang-and-Cloud/). The first event
will be held at [Basislager Leipzig](https://www.basislager.co/), Friday, 8th
of February 2019, 19:00 to 21:00 (open end).

The goal is to establish a regular meetup, where people interested in the Go
programming language and various cloud technologies can meet, learn, present,
discuss and network.

Initial organizers are [miku](https://github.com/miku/),
[klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet),
[panzerdev](https://github.com/panzerdev) and
[dataduke](https://github.com/dataduke), and we are inviting everyone to
contribute or participate.
