title: "Leipzig Gophers"

We're starting a [Go](https://golang.org/) [Meetup in
Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/Leipzig-Golang/) in Leipzig (we started as *Go
and Cloud Native*, but
[split](https://golangleipzig.space/posts/go-cloud-native-split/) in Fall
2019). For 2019 we plan to host about one meetup per month. The next event (#8)
is scheduled for November 2019 at [Basislager](https://www.basislager.co/).

Our goal is to establish a place, where people from all backgrounds interested
in the Go programming language (golang) and various cloud technologies can meet, learn,
share experiences, present, discuss and network.

Initial organizers are [miku](https://github.com/miku/),
[klingtnet](https://github.com/klingtnet),
[panzerdev](https://github.com/panzerdev) and
[dataduke](https://github.com/dataduke), and we are inviting everyone to
contribute or participate.

Your company uses Go or wants to look into it? Why not connect with the local
Go community by hosting a user group event? We do have presentations on
interesting technical topics and spark lively discussions. If you are
