## Talk Proposals

Thanks for your interest in giving a presentation at Leipzig Gophers, we appreciate your input.

As for topics, we are interested in anything related to the Go programming
language, including its uses, e.g. in the cloud and infrastructure domain, best
practices, experiences from real world projects, and other topics. In the
[past](https://golangleipzig.space/tags/summary/), we had presentations on a
wide range of topics, from langauge features, concurrency, networking,
container technology, machine learning, tools, testing, security, databases,
and much more.

### Formats

We are very flexible concerning formats, here are some examples:

* lightning talk (5 min)
